# Churn Dashboard

This Tableau project involved working with a raw Telcom dataset to a provide prescription and predictive analysis on the reason why customer churn and areas the business should keep an eye on and provide measures to adequately mitigate customers churn/attrition to the bearest minimum. 

The first step was cleaning the raw data by removing any duplicates or irrelevant data. 

Next, column filtering was performed to narrow down the data set to only the necessary columns. Data type sorting was then used to ensure the correct data types were assigned to each column.

The project also involved cleaning missing data by either imputing the missing values or removing the rows with missing data. 

Redundant columns were dropped to simplify the data set and make it easier to work with.
Once the data was cleaned and ready for insight extraction, the project was imported into Tableau and it focused on generating prescriptive and predictive insights and KPIs. 

Various visualizations were created, including bar charts, pie chart, donut chart, and column charts, and other types of visualization as applicable to identify trends and patterns in the data. 

These visualizations were used to generate KPIs such as: 
- Total customers
- Total churn
- %Churn rate
- Churn by contract type
- Churn by payment type
- Churn by Gender
- Customers by Gender
- Churn by Services etc.

Overall, this Tableau project demonstrates my proficiency in working with raw data, cleaning and filtering data, generating insights and KPIs using Tableau, and presenting data in a visually appealing and informative manner.
